# Backend NPM 
In this project, I learned the basics of using npm, including how to work with the package.json and how to manage your installed dependencies.
The major steps were :
  * How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package
  * Add a Description to Your package.json
  * Add Keywords to Your package.json
  * Add a License to Your package.json
  * Add a Version to Your package.json
  * Expand Your Project with External Packages from npm
  * Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning
  * Use the Tilde-Character to Always Use the Latest Patch Version of a Dependency
  * Use the Caret-Character to Use the Latest Minor Version of a Dependency
  * Remove a Package from Your Dependencies
